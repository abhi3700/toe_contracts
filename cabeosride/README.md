# Ride contract
## RAM table
* the table is stored in the contract acount.
* For each row, `ram_payer` would be users (driver/commuter) for their piece of data.
Ride table
----------------

Ride actions
--------------------
- Here, if the table is created automatically once contract is deployed, then 'create' action not needed.
- add a security layer i.e. check for loc data  when the ride is booked & the action is repeatedly pushed with the same data, it should not consume RAM, CPU, NET. It could be a technical glitch.
- To decide whether 'bookify' or 'book' & 'modify', check whether default values in argument can be parsed like in 'ride_status' If yes, then make 2 actions - 'book' & 'modify'
- [ ] create (to create the table)
- book or bookify
- [ ] modify
